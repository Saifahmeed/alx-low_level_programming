Task 0.0: Create a function that converts a binary number represented as a string of 0s and 1s to an unsigned integer. Return 0 if the string is NULL or contains non-binary characters.

Task 1.1: Develop a function that prints the binary representation of a given unsigned long integer. Do not use arrays, malloc, or the % or / operators.

Task 2.10: Write a function that takes an unsigned long integer and an index and returns the value of the bit at the specified index. Return -1 if there is an error.

Task 3.11: Create a function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1 in an unsigned long integer. Return 1 if successful and -1 if there is an error.

Task 4.100: Develop a function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0 in an unsigned long integer. Return 1 if successful and -1 if there is an error.

Task 5.101: Create a function that takes two unsigned long integers and determines the number of bits that need to be flipped in one number to transform it into the other number. Do not use the % or / operators.
